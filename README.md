# Ejuice Calculator

This is a simple Node webapp that serves up an Ejuice Calculator--this project came about because:
* I quit smoking and started vaping. I make my own juice because I enjoy it and I'm cheap.
* I wanted a browser-based mixing calculator that allowed me to mix by weight.
* None of the other calculators I have found are FOSS.

Currently, the app saves configuration in a cookie--I know this isn't ideal, but I'm new to Node and am just learning my way around. I intend to rewrite the app with user-authentication, which will allow the saving of custom recipes as I have time.
